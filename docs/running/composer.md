# Install and run drumkit with composer

:warning: You should not use composer to install and run drumkit even though it's possible.
Prefer to use [cpx](https://cpx.dev/) if you don't want to use docker.

_Notice: you should not use it because it comes with all the dependencies of drumkit which may conflict with yours!_

```
composer require swagindustries/drumkit
```
